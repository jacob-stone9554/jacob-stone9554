- Hi! My name is Jacob Stone
- I'm a full stack software engineer. I specialize in web development, but I do a little bit of everything! I've been busy with my professional work so I am not committing here quite as often.
- I primarily work with C#, ASP.NET Core, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- You can reach me at jacobmichaelstone@outlook.com, feel free to reach out!
- Outside of writing code, I climb mountains in my free time :)
